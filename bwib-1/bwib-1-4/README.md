*In this section you will get to know the game of life, and see how we can create and connect the cells*


In **Conway's Game of Life** every cell follows two simple rules:
  
1. If the cell is alife, and the number of living neighbors is between 3 and 4, stay alife.  
 (otherwise the cell dies)  
2. If the cell is dead, and the number of living neighbors is ecactly 3, become alife.  
   (otherwise the cell stays dead)
   
The neighborhood of a cell is made up of 8 cells (Moore Neighborhood)

The shorthand for this rule is `34/3`.
